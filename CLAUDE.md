# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

GPX Journey Visualiser — a React + Vite + Three.js web app that renders GPX routes in 3D with animated playback. Dark, cinematic UI. Supports multi-leg trips (multiple GPX files as separate coloured segments) and 4 view modes: Free-rotate, Isometric, First-person fly-through, Top-down with speed/elevation colouring.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `npm run preview` — preview production build locally
- `node scripts/build-index.js` — scaffold public/gpx/index.json from .gpx files
- `node tests/gpxParser.test.js [file.gpx]` — run parser + transform tests

## Key Libraries

- **@react-three/fiber** + **@react-three/drei** — React renderer for Three.js
- **three** — 3D engine
- **zustand** — state management (works across R3F canvas boundary)
- **tailwindcss v4** — styling (via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin)

## Conventions

- Canvas (3D) components live in `components/canvas/`, HTML UI in `components/ui/`
- Coordinate conversion from GPS → scene space is in `utils/geoTransform.js`
- Multi-leg trips share global bounds via `computeGlobalBounds()` + `overrideBounds` option
- Camera default is computed dynamically from scene bounds (azimuth 45°, polar 30°, distance from bbox diagonal) — never hardcoded coordinates
- SeaPlane renders at global minY and responds to elevation exaggeration changes
- Reset view button triggers `cameraResetKey` in the store, which CameraFit listens to
- GPX files in `public/gpx/` are gitignored — manifest is `public/gpx/index.json`
- View mode and colour mode constants defined in `src/constants/`
- AnimatedDot publishes `dotPosition` and `dotData` to the Zustand store each frame for cross-component communication (DotTrail, CameraFollow, LiveStatsBar, DayNightBackground all read from it)
- Playback uses cumulative driving time, not wall clock time — gaps > 5 minutes (REST_THRESHOLD_MS) are skipped as rest stops; the `usePlaybackPoints` hook stamps each point with `drivingTimeMs`
- Playback is continuous across legs — dot transitions seamlessly when one leg ends and the next begins
- Settings slice in Zustand store holds all visual feature toggles and slider values with defaults:
  - `autoOrbit` (true), `autoOrbitSpeed` (0.05 rad/s)
  - `dotTrail` (true), `dotTrailWidth` (3)
  - `cameraFollow` (false)
  - `legLabels` (true), `ambientParticles` (true), `routeGlow` (true)
  - `liveStats` (true), `dayNightBg` (false), `elevationProfile` (false)
  - `cinemaMode` (false), `verticalPreview` (false), `cinemaTitle` (false), `titleCard` (false)
- City name billboard labels are deduplicated by proximity (DEDUP_RADIUS = 2 scene units) so a junction city like Dindigul only appears once despite being shared by multiple legs
- Leg names in legend (top-left) and playback bar are driven entirely by the `leg` field in index.json — no hardcoding anywhere
- Three colour modes (LEG/SPEED/ELEVATION) implemented in RouteTrail with per-point vertex colouring via Drei `<Line vertexColors>`; global normalisation across all legs for consistent colours
- RouteGlow matches the active colour mode — same vertex colour array at wider lineWidth + lower opacity
- GradientLegend component swaps between leg legend (colour dots) and gradient bar legend based on active mode
- Intro animation: IntroAnimation component starts camera at 2.5x fitted distance looking top-down, eases to default position over 3s while route opacity fades 0→1 (imperatively via useFrame, no re-renders); plays once per page load, toggleable via `introAnimation` setting
- DropZone component removed — app loads exclusively from manifest (`public/gpx/index.json`)
- ElevationProfile (`src/components/ui/ElevationProfile.jsx`) — full-width bottom panel (80px), Canvas 2D area chart with elevation gradient fill, leg boundary markers inside the chart, playback indicator, click-to-scrub, hover tooltip; pinned flush to viewport bottom (`bottom-0 left-0 right-0`)
- Bottom layout uses conditional bottom offsets: PlaybackControls and ControlsPanel read `settings.elevationProfile` and switch between `bottom-[92px]` (chart visible, 80px chart + 12px gap) and `bottom-6`/`bottom-4` (chart hidden). ElevationProfile is conditionally rendered in App.jsx (`settings.elevationProfile && <ElevationProfile />`) — not CSS hidden — so layout calculations work correctly when toggled off
- Cinema mode (`C` key) hides all UI overlays (controls, stats, legend, settings, elevation profile) and 3D leg labels, leaving only the route + animated dot visible. `cinemaTitle` setting keeps a subtle journey title visible in cinema mode
- Vertical preview overlay (phone icon button) draws a centred 9:16 rectangle with darkened surround (60% black), white border, and faint safe zone guides (caption zone bottom 15%, buttons zone right 10%). Used to frame the OpenScreen recording region, then turned off before recording — the scene is not constrained, only visually guided
- Recording guide at `docs/RECORDING_GUIDE.md` documents the full OpenScreen workflow for Instagram Reels
- TitleCard (`src/components/ui/TitleCard.jsx`) — fades in journey title + total distance for 2.5s at playback start when both `cinemaMode` and `titleCard` settings are on
- Auto-play sequence (`R` key): resets playback → 1s pause → enables cinema mode → plays. Buttons for C/vertical/R appear next to the gear icon
- Settings panel auto-closes when playback starts; cinema mode hides the settings panel entirely
- AnimatedDot forces white colour when `colourMode` is SPEED for contrast against gradient ribbon
